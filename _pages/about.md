I'm an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Yale University.  I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2012, and then spent three years in the Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University.

If you are interested in joining the American Statistical Association [Astrostatistics Interest Group](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2014/08/01/astrostats-group/), please see visit [this website](https://community.amstat.org/astrostats/home) for directions on how to join.

The Cosmostatistics Initiative ([COIN](https://cosmostatistics-initiative.org)) is another great way to get involved in research at the intersection of astronomy/astrophysics/cosmology and statistics/data science/computer science. 

My husband, Kevin, and I are originally from the Midwest and now live on the coast of Connecticut.
