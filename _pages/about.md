I'm an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and then joined the Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University followed by the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Yale University.

If you are interested in joining the American Statistical Association [Astrostatistics Interest Group](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2014/08/01/astrostats-group/), please see visit [this website](https://community.amstat.org/astrostats/home) for directions on how to join.

The Cosmostatistics Initiative ([COIN](https://cosmostatistics-initiative.org)) is another great way to get involved in research at the intersection of astronomy/astrophysics/cosmology and statistics/data science/computer science.
